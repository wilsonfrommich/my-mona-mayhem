**VS Code & GitHub Copilot CLI Workshop** — Build a GitHub Contribution Battle Arena

A workshop template for building a retro arcade-themed website with Astro that compares GitHub contribution graphs of two users. This is the **starting point** — you'll build the app step by step using GitHub Copilot.

*What you'll build by the end of the workshop*

The workshop supports two tracks — follow the one that matches your preferred workflow:

- **VS Code track** — Chat, Plan Mode, Agent Mode, background agents, and editor-native review loops
- **CLI track** — `copilot`, `@file` context, `/plan`, autonomous edits, `/fleet`, `/delegate`, and `/review`
